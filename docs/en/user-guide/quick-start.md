simplified.

You can have a quick start following [Kubernetes-with-Dragonfly](../ecosystem/Kubernetes-with-Dragonfly.md)

This table describes some container runtimes version and documents.

| Runtime | Version | Document | CRI Support | Pull Command |

| Docker | All | [Link](./proxy/docker.md) | No | docker pull docker.io/library/alpine |
| Containerd without CRI | All | [Link](./proxy/containerd.md) | No | ctr image pull docker.io/library/alpine |
| Containerd with CRI | v1.1.0+ | [Link](./registry-mirror/containerd.md) | Yes | crictl pull docker.io/library/alpine:latest |

When using Dragonfly in Kubernetes, we recommend to use `Containerd with CRI` and `CRI-O`, deploying document can be
