# Dragonfly V1 API

We encourage users to experience Dragonfly in different ways. When doing this, there are three ways users could choose to interact with dragonfly mostly:

* For end-users, command line tool `dfget`, `dfdaemon` is mostly used.
* For developers, Dragonfly manager's raw API is the original thing they would make use of. For more details about API docs, please refer to 
  [api.md](/docs/en/api-reference/api.md). We should also keep it in mind that doc [apis.md](../docs/en/api-reference/api.md) is automatically generated by 
  [swagger2markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup). Please **DO NOT** edit [api.md](../docs/en/api-reference/api.md) directly.

Directory `/api` mainly describes the second part **Dragonfly Manager's Raw API**.

Currently, the description of swagger format is provided, which can be viewed in `manager`. It contains two format files of swagger, JSON and yaml. You can 
browse through relevant viewing tools to obtain the specific call method of API, or view online through the `/swagger/doc.json` endpoint of manager service.

Through manager's API, you can integrate with your own services, so you can automatically manage dragonfly and improve the level of Devops.
