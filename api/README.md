# Dragonfly V1 API

We encourage users to experience Dragonfly in different ways. When doing this, there are three ways users could choose to interact with dragonfly mostly:

* For end-users, command line tool `dfget`, `dfdaemon` is mostly used.
* For developers, Dragonfly manager's raw API is the original thing they would make use of. For more details about API docs, please refer to [api.md](../docs/api_reference/api.md). We should also keep it in mind that doc [apis.md](../docs/api_reference/api.md) is automatically generated by [swagger2markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup). Please **DO NOT** edit [api.md](../docs/api_reference/api.md) directly.

Directory `/api` mainly describes the second part **Dragonfly Manager's Raw API**.
